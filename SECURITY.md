# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open an issue on GitHub to report security issues. If you believe your security issue is too sensitive for a public issue, email diabotsecurity@cascer1.space

Use GPG key [`11B9 1DA8 4CB9 0746`](0x4CB90746_public.asc) for encryption if you wish.

## Testing diabot for vulnerabilities

If you think that there might be a security issue in the Diabot code, please run your own instance of the bot to test this. This way, the chance of accidentally exposing private data is reduced. 
If you believe that the potential issue cannot be reproduced without using the live version of diabot, please email diabotsecurity@cascer1.space before attempting to reproduce the issue.
